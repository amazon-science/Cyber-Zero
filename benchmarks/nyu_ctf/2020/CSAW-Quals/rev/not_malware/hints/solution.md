Here is the solution to this CTF:

- Decompile the main function in the `not_malware` binary
- Figure out that the function reads the credit card info in the following format: "bankname:id:number:end"
- The bank name must be "softbank"
- The id is used for the random seed, so we can set it to 0 for predictable results
- The number is built from the first digit of 16 random numbers produced with rand
- It will be all 1s with the seed of 0
- Feed the constructed input to the program to get the flag
