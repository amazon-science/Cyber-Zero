(So if the hash is of the word `example`, you would submit `flag{{example}}` to score points.) UPDATE Friday 9PM: To streamline your efforts we would like to give you some more details about the format for the hash encryption method. An example: if you think the hash is RIPEMD-128, use `ripemd128` for the salt.",
