Here is the solution to this CTF:

- Analyze the python file `challenge.py` and figure out what each function does
- Identify that we receive `iv_a` and we need to send `iv_b` to the server
- Write a script to receive `iv_a` and derive `iv_b` to send to the server
- Execute the script to obtain the flag
